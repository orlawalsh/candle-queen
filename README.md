# About 

The aim of this project was to create an elegant user-friendly website for a local candle making business, amied at candle lovers and those looking to support and source from small local businesses. I wanted to create a site where users can any information they need relating to the products and services that Candle Queen have to offer.

# Description

# UX
## Strategy

**Business Goals**

* To engage with potential customers and display our current range of products.
* To encourage users to interact with us and buy our products.
* To increase online presence and expand our customer base.
* To expand our product range through user feedback.

**User Stories**

* As a user of the website, I would like to read reviews on the company/products before deciding to purchase.
* As a user of the website, I would like to be able to subscribe to a newsletter so I can keep up to date on new products and receive exclusive discounts.
* As a user of the website, I would like be able to contact the company with questions before making a purchase.
* As a user of the website, I would like to view products and learn more about them before deciding to purchase.
* As a user of the website, I would like to be able to check out the company on various social media.
* As a user of the website, I would like to be able to purchase giftboxes as a gift for friends and family.
* As a user of the website, I would like to read about the company and discover who is behind the brand.

## Scope

The website was built using a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) methodology approach:

* This keeps the website from over loading users with too much information at once, which is particularly important for first time users.
* Makes the website easy to navigate and find the information they are looking for quickly.
* This is inline with the needs of the business owner and the user.

## Structure

The breakdown of the site structure is as follows:

* Home Page -
* Product Page -
* Giftbox Page -
* About Us Page -
* Contact Us Page -

### Images

All images were sourced from [UnSplash](https://unsplash.com/) and have been referenced in the credit section. 

### Colours

For my colour palette I took inspriation for the colour sheme from [Color Palettes](https://colorpalettes.net) - This is really helped to visualize the colours and how them would interact with each other as they supply images of the colours in pratice along side the palette. I didn't choose a set palette from the site, I used colours from a couple of different ones and created my own palette. 

This final colour palette I settled on is below:

I used [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/) to create the above screenshot and to see the colours side by side.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to find a suitable font for the site. The font I decided on was "Karla", it is a very simple font that is easy to read while still adding extra style to the site. Sans-Serif is being used as a backup font.

### Icons

Font Awesome was used for any icons needed for the site. This included the social media icons in the footer and the various icons that are added to the contact page.
