# About 

The aim of this project was to create an elegant user-friendly website for a local candle making business, amied at candle lovers and those looking to support and source from small local businesses. I wanted to create a site where users can access any information they need relating to the products and services that Candle Queen have to offer.

# UX
## Strategy

**Business Goals**

* To engage with potential customers and display our current range of products.
* To encourage users to interact with us and buy our products.
* To increase online presence and expand our customer base.
* To expand our product range through user feedback.

**User Stories**

* First Time Visitor Goals

* As a site owner, I want to expand our product range by gaining feedback from the users.
* As a site owner, I want to engage with potential customers and display our current range of products for them to view.

## Scope

The website was built using a MVP (Minimum Viable Product) methodology approach:

* This keeps the website from over loading users with too much information at once, which is particularly important for first time users.
* Makes the website easy to navigate and find the information they are looking for quickly.
* This is inline with the needs of the business owner and the user.

## Structure

The breakdown of the site structure is as follows:

* Home Page - index.html:
  - Provides an overview of the company and the products.
  - A section with information about our giftboxes and link to giftbox page to explore further.
  - A section with information about our products and link to products page to explore further
  - A testimonial section with reviews from current customers to build trust in the brand.
* Product Page - products.html:
  - Displays product images and names of all products available.
* Giftbox Page - giftbox.html
  - Displays giftbox images and names to promote the upcoming products.
* About Us Page - about.html
  - Displays information about the company.
  - Displays images of the owners behind the brand.
* Contact Us Page - contact.html
  - Consists of a contact form, google maps and other location/contact information.

All pages consist of a navigation bar at the top and a footer at the botton which includes an option to sign up to our newsletter and also links to find us on social media.

## Surface

### Images

All images were sourced from [UnSplash](https://unsplash.com/) and have been referenced in the credit section. 

### Colours

For my colour palette I took inspriation for the colour sheme from [Color Palettes](https://colorpalettes.net) - This is really helped to visualize the colours and how them would interact with each other as they supply images of the colours in pratice along side the palette. I didn't choose a set palette from the site, I used colours from a couple of different ones and created my own palette. 

This final colour palette I settled on is below:
![Colour Scheme](https://github.com/orlawalsh/candle-queen/blob/master/assets/images/colour-scheme.png)

I used [Color Mind](http://colormind.io/) to create the above screenshot and to see the colours side by side.

### Typography

I used Google Fonts to find a suitable font for the site. The font I decided on was "Karla", it is a very simple font that is easy to read while still adding extra style to the site. Sans-Serif is being used as a backup font.

### Icons

Font Awesome was used for any icons needed for the site. This included the social media icons in the footer and the various icons that are added to the contact page.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Navbar
* The Navbar consists of links to each of the pages on the site.
* It is fully response so it resizes to the device.
* The logo is clickable to help return to the home page easily.

### Home 
* The page consists of a carousel at the top which prompt users with buttons to go to the product page or sign up to the newsletter.
* A section with information about our giftboxes and link to giftbox page to explore further
* A section with information about our products and link to products page to explore further
* A testimonial section with reviews from current customers to build trust in the brand.

### Products
* Contains information about our current products.
* The page consists of current products including images of them with a popup modal box which displays further information about each one.

### Giftboxes
* Contains information about what the upcoming giftboxes will include.
* The page consists of four giftbox images with a popup modal box which displays further information about each one.

### About
* Displays information about who we are and what we do.
* Display photos of the people behind the business.

### Contact
* Allows users to get in contact via a form with any questions they may have.
* Displays locational informaion and additional contact information.

### Footer
* Includes links to social media which is displayed as the icon of the relevant platform, which open in new tabs once clicked.
* A form for users to sign up to our newsletter. 

## Features Left to Implement
* Adding functionality to the newsletter form - Since the project is to create a static site, this is beyond what we have learned so far but inscructions on how to do this will be included in future modles.
* Adding functionality to the form on the contact us page - Similar to the newsletter, this is beyond what we have learned so far but inscructions on how to do this will be included in future modles.
* Scroll to top button - to help users return back to the top quickly without loads of scrolling. This might require some JavaScript so may not be possible.
* Add to cart/check-out function - This is a little out of scope for this project but would make a great addition to the site in the future.

# Testing

## Automated Testing

### [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)  
![HTML Validation](https://github.com/orlawalsh/candle-queen/blob/master/assets/images/html-validation.png)

There was one issue that showed up on the HTML Validator and this was due to a < section > element missing a < h > tag. This was easily rectified by adding a < h > to the section that was flagged.

### [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
![CSS Validation](https://github.com/orlawalsh/candle-queen/blob/master/assets/images/css-validation.png)

There were no issues reported on the CSS Validator. 

### [Google Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
![Google Mobile Friendly Test](https://github.com/orlawalsh/candle-queen/blob/master/assets/images/mobile-validation.png)

All pages were checked with Google Mobile Friendly Test and all pages passed with no issues.

### [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) 

WAVE was also used for testing to ensure the site is adhearing to accessibility guidelines.

### [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) 
![Lighthouse Results](https://github.com/orlawalsh/candle-queen/blob/master/assets/images/lighthouse-results.png)

I also used Lighthouse for testing the performance. I was able to get very strong results, all in the high 90's or 100. Above is a sample of the results I was seeing.

Some pages came back with suggestions to resize and optimize the images for better performance. I was able to address this by using [Resize Image](https://resizeimage.net/) to resize and optimize any images on the site.

### [GTmetrix](https://gtmetrix.com/)
![GTmetrix Results](https://github.com/orlawalsh/candle-queen/blob/master/assets/images/gtmetrix-results.png)

I used GTmetrix as another tool for performance testing. I was also getting excellent results there too. Most areas on that report were high 90s and 100 again. The only areas that heavily fell down was "Add Expires headers" and "Leverage browser caching", both of these are outside of my control at the moment as those are not settings that can be configured on GitHub Pages.

### Manual Testing

#### Form Testing:
* I tested by trying to submit the contact form by pressing the "Submit" button with no input added to any fields which resulted in a "Please fill out this field" response. I repeated this for each field to ensure the form would not submit until all fields were filled out. 

* I also tested the newsletter signup form in the footer of all pages. I tested by pressing the "Submit" button with no email address added, this resulted in a "Please fill out this field" response. This test was carried out on all pages.

#### Link Testing:
* The first links I tested were the internal links, I ensured all links in the navigation bar direct to the correct page by clicking on each one from each page. I also tested the social media icons in the footer of each page. All links are direcing to the correct platform and have the `target="_blank"` attribute so they open in a new tab rather than it opening on the current page and the user being taken away from the site. The `rel="noopener` attribute was also added as a test with Lighthouse suggested to add this to improve performance and prevent security vulnerabilities.
* I have tested that clicking the logo links back to the index.html page on all pages.

#### Modal Testing:
* The modal boxes on the products and giftbox pages were all tested by clicking on the "More Info" button, once clicked, the modal displaying the information popped up. Once the modal popped up the close button and "X" button were also tested to ensure the modal can be closed once finished with it.

#### Carousel Testing:
* The Carousel was tested to ensure the next and previous buttons were working and the slide selector at the botton of the carousel was also tested. 
* The Carousel image changes based on screen resolution so this was tested to ensure the correct image was displayed based on screen resolution.

#### Devices used for testing:
I used a mix of devices for all the above testing. BrowserStack along with my own devices, friends and families devices were used for testing.

* Mobile devices:
  * Xiaomi: Mi 10T Pro, Note 10 Lite.
  * Samsung Galaxy: S10, S20, S21.
  * Google: Pixel 5, Nexus 6.
  * iPhone: 6S, 11, 11 Pro, 12.

* Tablet devices:
  * Samsung Tab: A7.
  * iPad: Pro 12.9, Mini 2019.

* Browsers:
  * Chrome.
  * FireFox.
  * Safari.
  * Edge.

### User Story Testing:

#### First Time Visitor

"As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able be able to understand the purpose of the site."
> After loading the site, the user is presented with an attractive, minimalist, clean site. There is a simple navigation bar at the top of every page which makes it easy for the user to vist any page they wish and not get trapped in any section. Just under the navigation bar there is a carousel with buttons to direct the user to signup to our Newsletter or check out our products. Under the carousel, there is a short, quick to the point statement which makes it easy to understand the purpose of the site.

"As a First Time Visitor, I want to navigate around the site easily and find the content I am looking for."
> At the very top of the site, there is a simple navigation bar at the top of every page which makes it easy for the user to vist any page they wish. All sections are clearly labled to represent what each link will show so there are no surprises when they navigate to their chosen page.

"As a First Time Visitor, I want to see testimonials on the company/products. I also want easy access to their social media links so I check their social media to gauge how trustworthy or well know the company is."
> As the new user scrolls down to the bottom of the home page, they will be presented with testimonials from existing customers. Testimonials are displayed with a photo of the reviewee and accompanying text which highlights that existing customers experience. While they are at the bottom of the page checking the reviews, the links to social media are just below. They can also be found at the bottom of every page on the site. All links are opened in a seperate tab so the user is never taken away from the site.

#### Returning Visitor

"As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to contact the company with questions before making a purchase."
> The navigation bar includes a link to the contact page which makes it easier for the user to navigate straight to the page. Once on the contact page, there are a number of different wasys to get in touch. The user can fill out the on screen form which will be sent straight to the company once submitted. The user can also reach us on the phone number or email address provided and lastly the user can use the location provided to visit our store in person. The social media links are also included at the bottom of the page so the user could also reach out to us on any of those platforms with their queries.

"As a Returning Visitor, I want to view products and learn more about them before deciding to purchase.:
> The navigation bar includes a link to the product page which makes it easier for the user to navigate straight to the page. Just under the navigation bar there is a carousel, one of the slides includes a button to the product page. If they scroll down a little further, there is also a feature section which they can click to bring them to products also. Once on the products page, they can see photos of the products, just under the photo there is a "More Info" button, a modal will pop-up with further details about that particular product. Once they are done reading the information they can simple use the close button or "X" to close the modal and follow the same process to learn about the other products.

#### Frequent User

"As a Frequent User, I want to subscribe to a newsletter so I can keep up to date on new products and receive exclusive discounts."
> In the footer of the site, at the very bottom of the page just above the links to the social media. There is a "Sign up for our newsletter" heading with an input box for their email address. The user simply just needs to enter their email and click the "Subscribe" button.

"As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if any new products have been released."
> As a frequent user, the user would be easily able to navigate to the products or giftbox section to have a look at the new products.

# Project bugs and solutions
* GitHub seems to be displaying my code incorrectly when viewing the files within GitHub. The indentation is not showing up correctly for some reason. I have spent a number of hours on trying to fix it but have been unsuccessful. The strange thing is, when the exact same code is pulled to GitPod or to my local computer, the code displays correctly formatted on both. I brought the issue to the tutoring team for some help but they were unable to offer any guidance on why this might be happening. They suggested that it was displaying incorrect due to the fact that GitHub is not a coding editor. I haven't had this issue on GitHub before so I'm not sure what might be causing it. I tried re-formatting the code multiples times but I did not have any luck.
* I implented an overlay feature on the feature section of the home page. During testing, this did not work well for smaller resolutions as there was no mouse to hover over the images to show this feature. The solution I came up with for this was to implement buttons on the home page for those images, I then set some media queries in the CSS to trigger the buttons to only show up at a certain resolution size and to hide again once the resolution was over a certain size.
* I had an issue with the hamburger floating under the logo on small resolution sizes. It did not look good and is not a good user experience either. After a bit of research, I found this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46869157/keep-hamburger-menu-inline-with-logo) and following the advice here helped me address this issue.
* I also had an issue with keeping all the cards used for the products and giftboxes the same width and height. It did not look visually appealing to see this and also caused issues with responsiveness. I found this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37287153/how-to-get-images-in-bootstraps-card-to-be-the-same-height-width) and following the advice here with a little tweaking, I was able to address this issue.
* After implementing the carousel, I noticed during testing that the carousel image did not look good on certain resolution sizes, the image looked very pixelated and the quality did not look good. I was able to resolve this issue by implementing media queries in the CSS to trigger different carousel images to load depending on the resolution size.
* Once I implemented the images for different resolution sizes within the carousel, I noticed the text on the carousel was difficult to read when the full image was behind it. To make the text easier to read and pop, I used media queries to switch the text to white and to add an overlay behind the text once a certain resolution size was reached.
* One final issue I found was on the home page when testing responsiveness in ChromeDevTools, when the screen reached a certain resolution size, it seems a block on white spaced was added down the right hand side of the page. I did extensive testing on this with ChromeDevTools and I was not able to track down any line of HMTL or CSS that might be causing it. While testing on actual mobile devices, I was not able to replicate this behaviour so I can only assume it must be some kind of bug within the ChromeDevTools.
